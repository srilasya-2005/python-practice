# Array and String Operations in Python

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates various array (list) and string operations in Python, including:

- Array/list insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching
- List extension, reversing, and sorting
- Counting and removing elements from lists
- List slicing
- Palindrome checking and character frequency counting in strings
- Counting vowels and consonants in a string
- Searching algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Jump Search
  - Exponential Search
  - Fibonacci Search
- Sorting algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort (for numbers and strings)
  - Bubble Sort
  - Counting Sort (for numbers and strings)
  - Radix Sort

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook (`cpt.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run each cell to see the output and understand the logic.
3. Some cells require user input; follow the prompts in the output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment (e.g., VS Code with Jupyter extension)
